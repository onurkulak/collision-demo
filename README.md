# collision-demo

This repo has the code for two demos:

1st one is collision demo which has its private code in the collisionDemo folder.
here you can see the video of it:

overall it'a pretty accurate implementation of impulse based rigid body dynamics


2nd one is a visual demo, it's a rendering of a room with a mirrorball and its code is inside the playground folder.
again you can see its video in this link:

it is a learning project for OpenGL and I implemented reflections caused by a mirrorball inside a room
